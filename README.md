- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alexis-brown

I am currently studying how to code. I have learned a little HTML and CSS on the way but at the moment I am learning Python.
With my studies, I want to learn how to automate with using Python and also work on becoming a cloud engineer one day.

I have a few projects already made from years ago but I want to teach myself again how to use Python and soon other coding languages.
